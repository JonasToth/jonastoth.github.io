Computers are omnipresent and ubiquitous devices performing all kinds of tasks, based on the information if electrical charge is present or not.
How is that possible?

This book gives you the practical proof of how the simple `0`s and `1`s our computers use turn into computation.
You are seeing how natural numbers are formed from bits, compared and calculated with.
It shows you, that the difference between naive and efficient multiplication is not slow vs fast, but uncomputable vs instant.

Code your own integer type by using the [<span data-feather='github'></span>Template Repository on github.com](https://github.com/curiositas-books/bring-your-own-int) and learn the most fundamental aspect of computing.
The template already provides a functional CI, a compiling skeleton for all necessary files and the corresponding reference implementation from the book.
This reference implementation provides a fully tested, clean and documented code base including example programs that utilize the implemented `BigUInt` type.

## Target Audience

All developers of any programming language can follow the code regardless of experience level.
The presented solution is complete and can be inspected in the reference implementation.
Concepts such as functions, loops and simple types are not introduced and are the only preliminary concepts to know.
All code is modern and simple `C++20` running on any platform and operating system.
