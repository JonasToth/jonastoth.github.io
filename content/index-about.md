This is a short page about my work. I am coder interested in understanding
fundamental aspects of our world, try hard to get educated in physics without
actually studying it. Addtionally, I like to go cycling.

My project **[Curiositas](https://curiositasbooks.gumroad.com/)** shows computational relationships with simple code.
