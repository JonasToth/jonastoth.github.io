This is a short page about my work. I am a coder trying to understand
fundamental aspects of our world. Physics and Computer Science spark my
interest most. Addtionally, I like to go cycling.

My project **[Curiositas](https://github.com/curiositas-books)** explains computational relationships with simple code.
The published books can be found on **[Gumroad.com](https://curiositasbooks.gumroad.com/)**.
